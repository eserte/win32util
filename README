Win32Util
---------

This is a collection of Win32 related functions. There are no strict
prerequirements for this module, however, full functionality can only
be achieved if some CPAN modules (Win32::Registry, Win32::API,
Win32::DDE, Win32::Shortcut ...) are available. By default, most of
these modules are already bundled with the popular ActivePerl package.

To install:

   perl Makefile.PL
   nmake all test install
